# Minimal Configuration to construct a PWA in React for mobile on firebase

## Initial Configuration

First of all create your web-application `create-react-app project-name`

goto public/manifest.json and change the short-name and name, the short-name will be the actual name of the application, and the short name the description

don't forget to add those meta below on public/index.html inside the header

    <meta name="author" content="author-name">
    <meta name="keywords" content="keywords">
    <meta name="description" content="description">

goto src/index.js and change serviceWorker.unregister() to serviceWorker.register()

remove the .css,.test and icon files from src and remove the public/favicon.ico too.
PS: Don't forget to remove every link/import of those files inside src/index.js and src/App.js

## Initial firebase Configuration

goto firebase console on the browser, create a account and then a new project
install firebase-tools globally with `npm i -g firebase-tools`

run the command `firebase login` and make the login using a firebase account then run `firebase init`
the cli will give you some options as follow
Hosting: Configure and deploy firebase hosting sites
? Select a default firebase project for this directory : (Firebase project)
? What do you want to use as your public directory ? build
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all url to /index.html)? N

goto firebase.json and write this code inside "hosting"
"headers": [{
"source": "/service-worker.js",
"headers": [{
